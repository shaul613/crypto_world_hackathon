# Just doing everything for client side in one file. We can discuss more in depth through slack. :)

**Things that were done well**

-   Nice bar on top. Calling the api well. :D
-   Can't fully test it, but it seems like the wallet functionalities will work as well, saving, converting, etc. (disregarding the issues pointed out from the back end)
-   Good you used `const`
-   Good you used small functions for your code.

**Things to improve**

-   A little messy. Just clean up a little here and there.
